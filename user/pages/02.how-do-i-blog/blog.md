So this is just me figuring out how to make this site function as a blog... I feel like there is something very simple that I'm missing.

Hmmmm...

Oh, I think I found it! There is a thing called `Page File` on the Advanced tab. I wonder if that was there during the page creation. I shall create another page/post and check.

~~woa! that's some weird stuff there!!!~~

## I get it!
This is the into to the blog, and this will render above the list of posts! _Awesome_
