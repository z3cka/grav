I'm Learning a lot about Grava and I feel the more I work with it the more I like it. I've already updated the version of this site twise sinse it has been live and I couldn't be more happy with the process. The face that everything is is code and or flat markdown files makes it really awesome. I'm starting to play with more and more of the plug-ins and will soon be looking into how they are written. I feel like I need to grock the existing ones first before I start looking under the hood.

Testing now if saving a unpublished will write to the disk... I don't see why it wouldn't. And it does!

I'm interested in figuring out what data types are all about. I've added the Data Manager but is doesn't look like I have any data to manage yet.

Okay, that's all the babbling for now..
